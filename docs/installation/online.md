Depending on how busy the Binder servers are, deployment may take between 1 min and 5 min.

## Google Colab

You can also use Google Colab. If you are using an outsourced jupyter, such as google colaboratory, you can also use an installation via the pip tool. At the python prompt, run: 

```
!pip3 install git+https://github.com/coa-project/pycoa.git
```
